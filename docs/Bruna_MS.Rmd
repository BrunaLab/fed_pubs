# Introduction 
Departments and agencies of the United States federal government conduct research on topics ranging from nuclear technology to economic policy. This work is thought to directly benefit the nation and its citizens in four ways: by providing the information needed by agencies to advance their missions, via the broad advancement of knowledge, through the application of this knowledge in ways that benefit society, and by developing human capital with education and professional experience [@usnationalacademyofsciencesusnationalacademyofengineeringusinstituteofmedicineuscommitteeonscienceResearchFederalGovernment1999]. Federal research is also a major driver of economic growth --- in addition to the direct economic impacts of the research enterprise (e.g., employment, purchasing, tax revenue), the resulting knowledge is also used by the private sector to develop novel technologies and products [@cunninghamReturnsPubliclyFunded2022; @leechForeignPatentsTechnology2022; @linkKnowledgeTransfersFederally2021]. As such the outputs from federal research and development are considered vital not only for addressing domestic needs, but also for enhancing the global competitiveness of US companies, informing international policy, and strengthening national security [@mandt2020federal].  

The Scopus bibliographic database indexes the content of over 200,000 books and 48,000 journals comprising all major fields of scholarship [@baasScopusCuratedHighquality2020]. Article records are uploaded daily from over 25,000 currently active journals, with the metadata for each record including such information such as the publication title, abstract, keywords, publication date. An article's record also includes the names and affiliations of all authors, both of which are assigned unique identification numbers. We identified N = `r comma(final_affils)` Scopus affiliation ID numbers assigned to Departments, Agencies, Commissions, and other units United States federal government (_Supplementary Materials_) and used them to quantify the volume research these units produced from January 2019 through August 2025. We found that the number of studies by authors affiliated with the federal government has declined precipitously in the first `r unique(perc_change_fed$PM)` months of 2025 relative to the same time period in any of the preceding `r nrow(perc_change_fed)-1` years (Figure \@ref(fig:cumulative-fig-fed)). This decline is ~60% greater than that observed at the 12 leading research universities in the United States (Figure \@ref(fig:cumulative-fig-uni)).

# Results  
We identified N = `r comma(total_pubs)` research articles, data papers, reviews, notes, and book chapters (hereafter, _'articles'_) in Scopus with at least one federally affiliated author and a publication date between January 1, 2019 and August 31, 2025. The articles in this corpus had a total of N = `r comma(unique_authors)` unique authors, of which N = `r comma(unique_fed_authors)` (`r comma(as.numeric(perc_papers_fed_first))`%) had federal primary affiliations. Federal researchers were highly collaborative: the articles in our data set had on average `r comma(mean_authors)` ± `r comma(sd_authors)` SD authors, of which `r comma(mean_nonfed_authors)` ± `r comma(sd_nonfed_authors)` SD affiliations outside of the US federal government.

Our analyses focus on the `r comma(perc_pubs_fed1st)`% of the articles with a federally affiliated first author. We restricted our analyses to first authors because of the inconsistent use -- both within- and across disciplines -- of last-author position to indicate the 'lead' or 'corresponding' author of a study [@burrowsTrendsAuthorshipOrder2011; @duffyLastCorrespondingAuthorship2017; @foxPatternsAuthorshipEcology2018]. Our estimates of changing productivity patterns are may therefore be conservative, particularly for disciplines (e.g., biomedical sciences) where last author position is a signal of research oversight [@pichiniAuthorshipManuscriptsSubmitted2005].

We identified N = `r comma(as.numeric(n2025))` articles published between January 1 and August 31, 2025 whose first author had a federal government affiliation. This is a `r comma(abs(as.numeric(perc_change_fed_last_yr)))`% decline relative to the same time period in 2024, and a `r comma(abs(as.numeric(drop_from_avg)))`% decline relative to the 2019-2024 average (Figure \@ref(fig:cumulative-fig-fed)). This decline in productivity is highly significant (P < 0.0001, see the _Supporting Information_ for a description of the bootstrapping procedure used to asses significance).

The search of university productivity was conducted using N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_summary_data %>% filter(value=="scopus_id") %>% select(n)))` Scopus affiliation IDs. It resulted in N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_pubs") %>% select(n)))` publications with N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_authors") %>% select(n)))` authors. There were N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_unique_authors") %>% select(n)))` unique authors in the data set, of which N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_focal") %>% select(n)))` had one of the focal universities as their primary affiliation. Each article had an average of N = `r comma(as.numeric(uni_auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Total") %>% select(mean_per_pub)))` ± `r comma(as.numeric(uni_auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Total") %>% select(sd)))` SD authors, of which `r comma(as.numeric(uni_auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Focal") %>% select(mean_per_pub)))` ± `r comma(as.numeric(uni_auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Focal") %>% select(sd)))` SD were affiliated with the focal universities (Figures \@ref(fig:cumulative-fig-uni),\@ref(fig:uni-decline-3)).  

# Discussion
Scholarly publications such as peer-reviewed journal articles are the primary means of documenting, validating, and sharing research results; the results the communicate are used to guide public policy and are the foundation on which future discoveries are built [@sciencesPurposePublicationResponsibilities2003]. We estimate that the US Federal Government --- historically a leading global producer of knowledge across a vast array of disciplines --- has accumulated a research publication deficit of `r comma(as.numeric(lost_articles[1,1]))`-`r comma(as.numeric(lost_articles[2,1]))` articles in the first `r as.english(unique(perc_change_fed$PM))` months of 2025. This deficit is driven by declining research output at several of the largest and most-research intensive agencies of the federal government --- productivity the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Veterans Affairs, and NASA all declined 15-20%, while the number of publications from the Smithsonian Institution and the Departments of Energy, Health & Human Services, and Agriculture decreased 9-15%. The greatest proportional decline was at the Department of the Interior, whose 2025 research output to date has declined `r round(abs(as.numeric(perc_change_agency %>% filter(agency_primary=="interior") %>% select(perc_previous))),0)`% relative to the same time period in 2024 (Figure \@ref(fig:agency-decline-3)).      

The proposed reductions to the budgets of federal agencies that support research and education, along with the ongoing efforts to strip universities of previously allocated research funds and limit the enrollment of international students [@malakoffHowTrumpUpended2025], have led a broad array of stakeholders to warn of an imminent and potentially catastrophic decline in the the scientific preeminence of the United States [e.g., @FederalResearchCuts2025; @bakerwill; @barocasCutsScientificFunding2025]. We suggest that these declines have already been set in motion, especially in several fields central to the economic, environmental, and national security interests of the United States. Given the disciplinary breadth and highly collaborative research conducted by the staff of federal agencies [@leydenFederalLaboratoriesResearch1999; @linkScientificPublicationsUS2021], it is likely the lasting consequences of these declines have already begun cascading through research institutions beyond the federal government.


 
# Materials and Methods

We searched the Scopus database for all articles published January 2019-August 2025 that included at least one co-author whose primary affiliation was a unit of the US federal government. To do so we first identifying N = `r comma(original_affils)` Scopus ID numbers for federal affiliations; these affiliation ID numbers included both the primary codes for government agencies (e.g., 60012471: US Department of Defense; 60000947: US Department of Commerce) and codes nested under them (e.g., 60032984: Naval Dental Center; 60027716: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). We then used the Scopus API to download the metadata for each Scopus ID's articles, data papers, reviews, notes, and book chapters published between 2019-2025. The author lists of the resulting articles were searched for any other federal affiliations not included in the initial query, and a second search was then conducted using the complete list of initial and subsequently identified affiliations (N = `r comma(followup_affils)`). After final data validation, the data set used for analyses comprised N = `r comma(final_affils)` federal affiliations; these affiliations and their Scopus codes can be found in the _Supporting Information_. 

<!-- WHAT FRACTION OF PUBS WERE COVEWRED BY AFFILS ORIGINAL aND FOLLOWUP? -->

Queries of the Scopus API were conducted using the `rscopus` library [@muschelliRscopusScopusDatabase2025] for the R statistical programming language [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2025]. The resulting `.csv` files for each year and affiliation ID were initially processed using the `refsplitr` library [@fournierRefsplitrAuthorName2025], after which we combined all data for all years, identified all federal and non-federal author affiliations, and assigned all affiliations to their highest parent agency, department, or organization. We then visualized productivity within and across agencies using the `tidyverse` libraries [@wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019] and used a bootstrapping procedure to assess whether productivity across all federal affiliations was significantly different in 2025.

Some US Geological Survey (i.e., USGS) scientists are based at universities under the auspices of the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units Program. Publications by these researchers are returned in Scopus searches when using the USGS code, but the primary affiliation provided by Scopus for the USGS authors is that of the host university (e.g., USGS Scientists at the Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit is "University of Florida"). To correct this we downloaded metadata from USGS [Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/) for the N = 17,445 articles published between 2019-2025 and used it to correct the affiliation of USGS authors in the Scopus records.  

We used the same workflow to search for all publications with at least one author whose primary affiliation was one of the USA's twelve most productive non-federal institutions (based on total number of indexed publications 2019-2025). All of these institutions were universities; the sole exception was Massachusetts General Hospital, which as the largest clinical education and research hospital for the the Harvard Medical School was combined with Harvard University for our analyses. As with the searches for federal agency productivity, these searches were conducted with the primary Scopus affiliation codes for institutions (e.g., 60030612 for the University of California, San Diego) and any codes for nested affiliations (e.g., 60121501 for the UCSD School of Biological Sciences). Searches used in all results presented here were conducted on September 1-4, 2025. 

Additional details on our procedures for data collection, processing, and analysis --- including links to the code and data repositories and complete affiliation lists --- are provided in the _Supporting Information_.
