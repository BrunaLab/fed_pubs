# Introduction

The staff of US federal government agencies are tasked with conducting research on topics ranging from the nuclear energy to national history. The nation and its citizens benefit from this work in four primary ways: via the broad advancement of knowledge, by the application of this knowledge in ways that benefit society, the development of human capital through education and professional experience, and because the results are used by agencies to achieve their mission [@usnationalacademyofsciencesusnationalacademyofengineeringusinstituteofmedicineuscommitteeonscienceResearchFederalGovernment1999]. Federal research is also a major indirect driver of economic growth - in addition to the direct economic impacts of the research enterprise (employment, purchasing, tax revenue), the resulting knowledge is also used both directly and indirectly by the private sector to develop novel technologies and products [@cunninghamReturnsPubliclyFunded2022; @leechForeignPatentsTechnology2022; @linkKnowledgeTransfersFederally2021]. As such the outputs from federal R&D are viewed as vital not only for addressing domestic needs, but also for the enhancing the global competitiveness of US industry, informing international policy, and strengthening national security [@mandt2020federal]. 

The Scopus bibliographic database indexes the content of over 200,000 books and 48,000 journals comprising all major fields of scholarship. Article records are uploaded regularly from over 25,000 currently active journals, with the metadata for each article record includes such information as the title, abstract, keywords, and issue cover date. It also includes names of all authors and their affiliations, both of are assigned a unique identification number, making it possible to track changes in author or institutional productivity over different time scales. We used this database to quantify the number of articles produced from 2019-2025 by N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="scopus_id_total") %>% select(n)))` Scopus ID numbers assigned to organizations of the US federal government (e.g., departments, agencies, commissions). 

We show that the volume of research produced to date by the US federal government has declined precipitously in 2025. From January-July the number of peer-reviewed publications whose first authors were affiliated with US federal agencies has fallen 20% relative to the same time period in 2024 and 24% relative to the 2019-2024 average. This decline - a deficit of 2600-4000 articles to date - is over double the decline observed at the ten most productive universities in the United States.

# Results  




The Scopus database includes N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_pubs") %>% select(n)))` items published January 2019-July 2025 with at least one coauthor whose primary affiliation was a US Government agency or institution in the Scopus Database. These articles were collectively written by N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_unique_authors") %>% select(n)))` unique authors, of which N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="total_federals") %>% select(n)))` had federal primary affiliations. `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="prop_papers_fed_1st") %>% select(n)))`% of articles had a first author with a federal primary affiliation. Federal researchers were also highly collaborative: articles had on average `r comma(as.numeric(auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Total") %>% select(mean_per_pub)))` ± `r comma(as.numeric(auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="Total") %>% select(sd)))` SD authors, of which `r comma(as.numeric(auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="NonFed") %>% select(mean_per_pub)))` ± `r comma(as.numeric(auth_per_pub_means %>% filter(author_category=="NonFed") %>% select(sd)))` SD had non-federal affiliations.


# Discussion

Of the agencies that were most productive from 2019-2024, there were two - the Veteran's Administration and the Department of Defense -  whose productivity declined over 30% relative to 2024.  

# Materials and Methods

We searched the Scopus database for all articles published January 2019-August 2025 that included at least one co-author whose primary affiliation was a unit of the US federal government. To do so we first identifying N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="scopus_id_total") %>% select(n)))` Scopus ID numbers for federal affiliations; these affiliation ID numbers included both the primary codes for government agencies (e.g., US Department of Defense: 60012471; US Department of Commerce: 60000947) and codes nested under them (e.g., Naval Dental Center: 60032984, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: 60027716). We then used the Scopus API to download the metadata for each Scopus ID's articles, data papers, reviews, notes, and book chapters published between 2019-2025. The author lists of the resulting articles were searched for any other federal affiliations not included in the initial query, and a second search was then conducted using these additional affiliations. In total we identified N = `r comma(as.numeric(summary_data %>% filter(value=="no_fed_affils") %>% select(n)))` federal affiliations; these affiliations and their Scopus codes can be found in the Supporting Information. 

Some US Geological Survey (i.e., USGS) scientists are based at universities under the auspices of the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units Program. Publications by these researchers are returned in Scopus searches when using the USGS code, but the primary affiliation provided by Scopus for the USGS authors is that of the host university (e.g., USGS Scientists at the Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit is "University of Florida"). To correct this we downloaded metadata from USGS [Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/) for the N = 17,445 articles published between 2019-2025 and used it to correct the affiliation of USGS authors in the Scopus records.  

We used the same workflow to search for all publications with at least one author whose primary affiliation was one of the USA's ten most productive non-federal institutions (based on total number of indexed publications 2019-2025). All of these institutions were universities; the sole exception was Massachusetts General Hospital, which as the largest clinical education and research hospital for the the Harvard Medical School was combined with Harvard University for our analyses. As with the searches for federal agency productivity, these searches were conducted both with primary and nested Scopus affiliation codes (e.g., ------- (primary), -------- (nested). Searches were conducted on  (date - federal affiliations) and (date - non-federal affiliations).  

We queried the Scopus API using the `rscopus` package for the R statistical programming language. The resulting `.csv` files for each year and affiliation ID were initially processed using the `refsplitr` package, after which we combined all data for all years, identified all federal and non-federal author affiliations, and assigned all affiliations to their highest parent agency, department, or organization. We then visualized productivity within and across agencies using the `tidyverse` libraries and used a bootstrapping procedure to assess whether productivity across all federal affiliations was significantly different in 2025. We did the same for universities to determine if their patterns of productivity over time were similar. Additional details on our procedures for data collection, processing, and analysis - including links to the code and data repositories and complete affiliation lists - are in the Supporting Information.
