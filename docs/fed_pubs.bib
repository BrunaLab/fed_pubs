  abstract = {America’s position as the world’s dominant nation began after World War II with the appreciation that science played an outsized role in winning the war. For that reason, the US decided that the growth of American science, through investments in its universities, would position the country both as a dominant force in science and as the world’s preeminent superpower.1 This was informed by the 1945 report to President Truman by Vannevar Bush entitled Science: The Endless Frontier. The result has been enormous economic and military gains for the US, spectacular advances in science and technology, major advances in the treatment of disease, and the birth of the high tech and biotech sectors. Now, a short 100 days into President Trump’s second term of office, the ecosystem that was built over the past 70 years—involving universities, the private sector, and government—has been the target of a concerted three-pronged attack: firstly by cutting billions of dollars and thousands of jobs from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug Administration; secondly, by installing political leadership to oversee these organisations who have disavowed belief in science; and thirdly, by attacking universities themselves, the central institutions that have been pivotal …},

  abstract = {In recent months the COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus) pandemic has spread throughout the world. In parallel, extensive scholarly research regarding various aspects of the pandemic has been published. In this work, we analyse the changes in biomedical publishing patterns due to the pandemic. We study the changes in the volume of publications in both peer reviewed journals and preprint servers, average time to acceptance of papers submitted to biomedical journals, international (co-)authorship of these papers (expressed by diversity and volume), and the possible association between journal metrics and said changes. We study these possible changes using two approaches: a short-term analysis through which changes during the first six months of the outbreak are examined for both COVID-19 related papers and non-COVID-19 related papers; and a longitudinal approach through which changes are examined in comparison to the previous four years. Our results show that the pandemic has so far had a tremendous effect on all examined accounts of scholarly publications: A sharp increase in publication volume has been witnessed and it can be almost entirely attributed to the pandemic; a significantly faster mean time to acceptance for COVID-19 papers is apparent, and it has (partially) come at the expense of non-COVID-19 papers; and a significant reduction in international collaboration for COVID-19 papers has also been identified. As the pandemic continues to spread, these changes may cause a slow down in research in non-COVID-19 biomedical fields and bring about a lower rate of international collaboration.},

Additionally, extensive quality assurance processes continuously monitor and improve all data elements in Scopus. Besides enriched metadata records of scientific articles, Scopus offers comprehensive author and institution profiles, obtained from advanced profiling algorithms and manual curation, ensuring high precision and recall. The trustworthiness of Scopus has led to its use as bibliometric data source for large-scale analyses in research assessments, research landscape studies, science policy evaluations, and university rankings. Scopus data have been offered for free for selected studies by the academic research community, such as through application programming interfaces, which have led to many publications employing Scopus data to investigate topics such as researcher mobility, network visualizations, and spatial bibliometrics. In June 2019, the International Center for the Study of Research was launched, with an advisory board consisting of bibliometricians, aiming to work with the scientometric research community and offering a virtual laboratory where researchers will be able to utilize Scopus data.},

This study was designed to analyze the yearly number of articles having an Akdeniz University address and that appeared in the Web of Science databases from 1996 to 2009. Time series analysis of the number of published articles was used to determine the impact of alterations in the number of faculty members and research funding as well as changes in the institutional and country-wide research support policies and encouragement mechanisms. It was observed that alterations in both the number of faculty members who are active in research and the total amount of research funding each year may explain the general pattern published articles. However, there is a period with significant deviations from the trend predicted by these relationships. This period, corresponding to the years 2002–2008, is discussed in terms of the effects of policy changes which may have positive and negative contributions to the predicted pattern. Mathematical analysis of publication time series, together with parameters expected to affect research output, may provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of research support mechanisms.},

So far, the literature answers by assuming new comparative advantages (in terms of learning or training) for East Asian countries and/or deficient research organization in Western economies. We develop an original micro-macro model based on the aggregation of individual knowledge production functions. Our model predicts the existence of a stable macro power law, relating the world share of countries' scientific production (publications and citations) to their world share of public investment in scientific research. We test and support this prediction, using bibliometric cross-country longitudinal data for OECD and non-OECD countries, over the 1996–2015 period. This analysis shows that East Asian countries’ impressive catch-up is due, to the first order, to sustained investment efforts in scientific research – efforts that are greater than those undertaken in traditional scientific countries.},

However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and regarding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manuscript. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos, I found that: (1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; (2) the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; (3) 84\% of papers published in 2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and (4) geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also carried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding authorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the “senior” author on a paper (i.e., the person who runs the research group in which most of the work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I suggest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author. I also suggest ways of deciding author order in cases where two senior authors contributed equally.},

These reports overstate the economic impact and programmatic relevance of existing state programs to the federal setting while understating state program contributions to the development and strengthening of regional technology infrastructures.

We examine gender differences in authorship in the ecology literature using two datasets: submissions to six journals between 2010 and 2015 (regardless of whether they were accepted), and manuscripts published by 151 journals between 2009 and 2015. Women were less likely to be last (i.e., “senior”) authors (averaging 23\% across journals, years, and datasets) and sole authors ( 24\%), but more likely to be first author ( 38\%), relative to their overall frequency of authorship ( 31\%). However, the proportion of women in all authorship roles, except sole authorship, has increased year-on-year. Women were less likely to be authors on papers with male last authors, and all-male papers were more abundant than expected given the overall gender ratio. Women were equally well represented on papers published in higher versus lower impact factor journals at all authorship positions. Female first authors were less likely to serve as corresponding author of their papers; this difference increased with the degree of gender inequality in the author's home country, but did not depend on the gender of the last author. First authors from non-English-speaking countries were less likely to serve as corresponding author of their papers, especially if the last author was from an English-speaking country. That women more often delegate corresponding authorship to one of their coauthors may increase the likelihood that readers undervalue their role in the research by shifting credit for their contributions to coauthors. We suggest that author contribution statements be more universally adopted and that these statements declare how and/or why the corresponding author was selected for this role.},

  abstract = {This paper documents the importance of foreign patents for the technology transfer of inventions created in the laboratories of the U.S. federal agencies. First, we describe the patent portfolios of the 11 federal agencies with 98 percent of the research performed within the laboratories of all U.S. federal agencies. Second, we estimate the distributed lag function showing the effects on license revenue of an agency’s history of patent applications for inventions granted U.S. patents. The estimation shows that those effects depend on whether the agency also obtained foreign patent protection for its inventions. Third, we estimate a dynamic panel data model of license revenues as a function of the history of applications and granted patents. The evidence supports the view that an agency that obtains U.S. patents for its technologies but does not obtain foreign patent protection disadvantages the corporations that license the agency’s technologies and then face international competition from firms that copy those technologies and compete with lower costs because they do not incur full development costs or pay royalties for licensing the technologies. An increase in foreign patents would increase the willingness of companies to undertake the development costs necessary to have successful commercial products, and technology transfer—with more remuneration to U.S. taxpayers via license royalties—of inventions from the laboratories of U.S. federal agencies would increase.},

The marginal costs of improving one's share are increasing over time. Countries differ considerably in terms of the efficiency of turning (financial) input into bibliometrically measurable output. Both funding schemes and disciplinary portfolios differ among countries. A price per paper can nevertheless be estimated. The percentages of GDP spent on academic research in different nations are significantly correlated to historical contingencies such as the percentage of researchers in the population. The institutional dynamics make strategic objectives such as the Lisbon objective of the EU – that is, spending 3\% of GDP for R\&D in 2010 – unrealistic.},

Utilizing annual report data from 685 NKLs in China between 2018 and 2022, regression analysis was conducted using SPSS software to examine the effects of the innovation environment on innovation output and diffusion. The results reveal that the innovation environment score (IE) has a significant positive impact on both innovation output (IP) and innovation diffusion (ID), with coefficients of 0.638 and 0.356, respectively, both significant at the 1\% level (p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Additionally, laboratory size (SIZE), national project funding (NPF), and the City Technology Innovation Index (CTII) also exhibit significant positive effects on innovation output and diffusion. The study indicates that a larger laboratory scale, a higher levels of national project funding, and a favorable city technology innovation environment contribute to enhancing the innovation quality of NKLs. This paper is pioneering in selecting NKLs as the research subject and confirms the significant impact of the innovation environment on the innovation quality of these laboratories, thereby extending the research scope on the influence of the innovation environment on the quality of innovation within research organizations. The findings provide empirical support and policy recommendations for the construction and management of NKLs..},

Factors such as energy prices and environmental policy influence both private and public R\&D decisions. Moreover, because government R\&D is further upstream from the final commercialized product, it may take several years for its effect on technology to be realized. Combining data on scientific publications for alternative energy technologies with data on government R\&D support for these technologies, we address these challenges. First, we ask how long it takes for energy R\&D to provide successful research outcomes. We both provide information on the lags between research funding and new publication and link these articles to citations in U.S. energy patents. One million dollars in additional government R\&D funding leads to 1-2 additional publications, but with lags as long as ten years between initial funding and publication. Second, we ask whether adjustment costs associated with large increases in research funding result in diminishing returns to government R\&D. There is no evidence of diminishing returns on the level of publication output, but some evidence that additional funding leads to lower quality publications, using citations as a measure of publication quality.},

Here, we show that forest disturbance due to fire is growing globally, with the most dramatic increases in intact forest landscapes, highlighting an existential threat to remaining high biomass, high biodiversity forests. The global annual area of forest disturbance due to fire for 2023 and 2024 was highest since the beginning of monitoring in 2001. Compared to 2002–2022 average annual forest disturbance due to fire, the 2023–2024 average was 2.2 times higher globally and 3 times higher in the Tropics. More than ¼ of all 2024 forest disturbance from fire occurred in tropical forests. We found a statistically significant increasing trend of forest disturbance due to fire from 2002 to 2024 in all climate domains except Subtropical. High forest, low deforestation tropical countries were not exempt, with Guyana and the Republic of the Congo experiencing record forest disturbance due to fire. Our results agree with recently estimated increases in global forest fire emissions and active fire detections. The unprecedented scale of fires in the world’s most remote forests is a potential harbinger of ecosystem tipping points. Protecting these remaining unfragmented high conservation value forests from this threat poses a daunting and as yet undeveloped policy and capacity challenge.},

The evidence comes from integer and fractional counts from Scopus and Web of Science. The explanatory variables come from a UNESCO data set that provided data from 93 countries; a subset of 43 industrialized nations from OECD, and another of 50 less industrialized nations. Models were built from cross sectional data plus panel data models combining longitudinal and cross-sectional data. GERD was shown to be an excellent explanatory variable. If a second explanatory variable is added to the model, the number of researchers adds some precision. Applications include forecasting publication counts from published funding plans, estimating the funding required for a nation to improve its publication performance, and using models for “what-if” experimentation.},

The increase in follow-on inventions is attributed to risk-taking inventions, that is, inventions involve a high chance of resulting in either impactful or failure patents, rather than incremental inventions. It is also characterized by inventions with a high level of originality. Inventors in distant locations in terms of geographical and technological proximity are most affected by the patents filed by government scientists. The patent effect is pronounced when the government scientists involved in the focal discovery have fewer social connections and when the scientific field is less familiar in the industry. These findings are consistent with the idea that patenting by government scientists helps facilitate the dissemination of technological information or potential of scientific discoveries in government laboratories. Policy and managerial implications are also discussed.},

In this study we present the varying involvement of academic researchers and government funding to capture the influence of funded research in order to help government agencies evaluate their efficiency in financing nanotechnology research. We analyze the measures of quantity and quality of research output using time-related econometric models and compare the results between nanotechnology scientists in Canada and the United States. The results reveal that both research grants and the position of researchers in co-publication networks have a positive influence on scientific output. Our findings demonstrate that research funding yields a significantly positive linear impact in Canada and a positive non-linear impact in the United States on the number of papers and in terms of the number of citations we observe a positive impact only in the US. Our research shows that the position of scientists in past scientific networks plays an important role in the quantity and quality of papers published by nanotechnology scientists.},

The results show sustained exponential growth from 1900, except for dips during both world wars, and with increased growth after 2004. Over the same period, the percentage of articles with 500+ character abstracts increased from 1\% to 95\%. The number of different journals in Scopus also increased exponentially, but slowing down from 2010, with the number of articles per journal being approximately constant until 1980, then tripling due to megajournals and online-only publishing. The breadth of Scopus, in terms of the number of narrow fields with substantial numbers of articles, simultaneously increased from one field having 1,000 articles in 1945 to 308 fields in 2020. Scopus’s international character also radically changed from 68\% of first authors from Germany and the United States in 1900 to just 17\% in 2020, with China dominating (25\%).},

S. economy and identify their practical value to the federal government. The research team surveyed T2 partners by asking questions regarding sales of new products and services resulting from the T2 agreements. They asked additional questions of companies whose agreements focused on nuclear weapons, stockpiles, and non-proliferation. The team obtained full or partial information from 93\% of the Cooperative Research and Development agreements and license agreements. The IMPLAN economic impact assessment model was used to estimate the economic impact of the related technologies. Major findings from the study included \$53.7 billion in total sales of new products and services from these agreements, including \$21.9 billion in sales of products to the government. The total economic impact nationwide was \$95.9 billion. Other findings included \$9.9 billion in new tax revenues, nearly \$1.7 billion in estimated cost savings, and 434,464 jobs supported, with an average compensation of approximately \$69,000 per year.},

Scholars from 3,790 universities and research institutes in 118 countries have published in the two premier journals over the period 2012–2019. Using these publication data, we explore two transmission channels: first, research output can be used for the development of innovations and inventions; second, such a technological advancement promotes economic growth. Instrumental variable (IV) estimation suggests that scientific publications have a causal effect on the enhancement of advanced technologies; the technology enhancement, in turn, has a causal effect on economic growth. Empirical evidence in direct support of these two relationships provide major incentives for governments and business firms to invest more towards future research in the fields of science and technology.},
